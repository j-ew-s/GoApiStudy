We downloaded a GO package that help us to handle URL, the Gorilla Mux. 
Gorilla Mux is package implements a request router and dispatcher (http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux).

To download Gorilla Mux  use go get github.com/gorilla/mux
This command will download the src to your GOPATH\src\github.com\gorilla folder, and when your project need this src, it will import from this destination folder.
